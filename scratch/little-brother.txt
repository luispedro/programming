If you've never programmed a computer, you should. There's nothing like it in
the whole world. When you program a computer, it does *exactly* what you tell
it to do. It's like designing a machine -- any machine, like a car, like a
faucet, like a gas-hinge for a door -- using math and instructions. It's
awesome in the truest sense: it can fill you with awe. 

A computer is the most complicated machine you'll ever use. It's made of
billions of micro-miniaturized transistors that can be configured to run any
program you can imagine. But when you sit down at the keyboard and write a line
of code, those transistors do what you tell them to. 

Most of us will never build a car. Pretty much none of us will ever create an
aviation system. Design a building. Lay out a city.

Those are complicated machines, those things, and they're off-limits to the
likes of you and me. But a computer is like, ten times more complicated, and it
will dance to any tune you play. You can learn to write simple code in an
afternoon. Start with a language like Python, which was written to give
non-programmers an easier way to make the machine dance to their tune. Even if
you only write code for one day, one afternoon, you have to do it. Computers
can control you or they can lighten your work -- if you want to be in charge of
your machines, you have to learn to write code.

We wrote a lot of code that night.
